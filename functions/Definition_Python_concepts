#####   The self
Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.
If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.
This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.
When we call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2), this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) – this is all the special self is about.

#####   __init__ method
The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.
Constructors are used to initializing the object’s state.
Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation.
It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.

#### Class and Instance Variables
Instance variables are for data, unique to each instance.
Class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class.

Instance variables are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method with self whereas class variables are variables whose value is assigned in the class.
Defining instance variable using a constructor.

#### Abstract Classes in Python
An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes.
It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.
Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC
Abstract classes may contain both concrete methods and abstract methods.

####  Inheritance in Python
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class
Base or Super class. Note object in bracket.(Generally, object is made ancestor of all classes)
In Python 3.x "class Person" is equivalent to "class Person(object)"
